## Ingredients 
(Recipe is for instant pot)

Makes 4-8 servings - easily doubles or even triples if you want

- 2 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
- 2/3 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/3 cup tamari or soy sauce
- 1 onion - large chunks, chopped coarsly 
- Green Onions - chopped, for garnish (optional)
- 10 to 12 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
- 2 bay leaves (optional)
- 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper, plus more as needed
- Salt (Optional with all the soy)
- Steamed white rice, for serving 

## Instructions

-  Start to cook 1 - 2 cups of rice in rice cooker or on stove

-  Add chicken to bottom on instant pot with onions and garlic. Cover with vinegar and soy sauce (and option bay leaves)
    
-  Pressue cook on high for 15 minutes. You can let it release naturally or open it to speed up the process
    
-  Take out the chicken and place on a rake - or put them on the grill. This is to give it color and crisp up the skin
    
-  While the chicken crisps up turn the instant pot on the saute setting and start to reduce the remaining liquid. 

-  Serve over rice and top with green onions. Top with sauce or serve that on the side. 



## Notes

The Sauce doubles or even triples easily. Is great on veggies the next day - 

You could add extra veggies if you'd like, I bet mushrooms would be great

Crisping up the chicken is optional but adds color if you have time
