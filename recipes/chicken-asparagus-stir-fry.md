## Ingredients 

FOR THE CHICKEN & MARINADE:
- 12 ounces chicken breast
(thinly sliced)
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon oil (any neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil)
- 1 teaspoon oyster sauce
FOR THE REST OF THE DISH:
- 1/2 cup water
(or low sodium chicken stock)
- 2 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons oil (any neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil)
- 1 clove garlic (minced)
- 1 pound asparagus (end trimmed and sliced on a sharp angle into 2-inch pieces)
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine

## Instructions

- In a medium bowl, combine the sliced chicken, water, cornstarch, oil, and oyster sauce. Mix until the liquid has been absorbed by the chicken. Set aside to marinate for 15-30 minutes.
- Meanwhile, combine the water (or chicken stock), cornstarch, white pepper, sugar, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil.
- Heat your wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke, and add 1 tablespoon of oil to coat. Spread the chicken evenly in one layer, and allow it to sear undisturbed for 30 seconds. Stir-fry for another 30 seconds, or until about 75% cooked. Remove from the wok and set aside.
- Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok, along with the minced garlic. Cook for 15 seconds, and add the asparagus. Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the Shaoxing wine and stir-fry for another 30 seconds.
- -Meanwhile, mix your sauce mixture to ensure the cornstarch is fully incorporated. Add it to the wok, and bring to a simmer.
- Add the chicken back to the wok, and stir-fry for another 30 seconds. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon, and the asparagus should be crisp-tender.
- Taste for seasoning and add additional salt to taste if needed. Serve over rice.
