-  Put cooked veggies and meat in a bowl. Combine with beans and any other spices you'd like. 
    
-  Add a cup or so of filling to each tortilla and loosly wrap. Place seam side down in casserole dish (doesn't have to be perfect)

## Notes

Add whatever veggies you want! 

Freezes well - don't add sauce though. Freeze with just stuffed tortillas and then add sauce when you take it out of the freezer and cook it.

This could be all veggies and extra beans
