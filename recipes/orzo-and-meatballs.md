## Ingredients 

Makes 5-7 servings (depends how many veggies / meatballs you put in)

-   20 or so Cooked frozen Meatballs of choice
-   2  cloves  garlic  (finely minced)
-   2½  cups  low sodium chicken broth
-   1½  cups  dry orzo pasta  (about 278 grams)
-   ⅔  cup  cream  (any kind – heavy cream will give a richer flavor, light cream will be a bit thinner)
-   ¼  cup  shredded Parmesan cheese
-   ½  teaspoon  salt
-   ¼  teaspoon  black pepper
- ½ an onion
- 2-3 cups of raw veggies of choice

## Instructions
-  Cook onion / garlic and then toss in veggies of choice (see notes below for recommendations). Saute until slightly soft. 
    
-   Add the broth and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to deglaze. Bring it to a low boil.
    
-   Add the orzo, cream, parmesan, salt, and pepper, and stir. Place the meatballs on top, cover, and simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes until the orzo is al dente. It might look liquidy at first, but it will thicken.
    
-   Taste and serve.

## Notes

This will burn easy! Keep on a low heat after you add the Orzo. Doesn't hurt to stir it a little while its cooking too

Veggies I like to add: Carrots, spinach, mushrooms, 

Stores / reheats well
