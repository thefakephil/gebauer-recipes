## Dough 

5 tablespoons (60g) olive oil
1 1/2 cups (340g) water, warm
1 1/4 teaspoons (8g) table salt
3 1/2 cups (420g) Bread / All Purpose Flour 
1 tablespoon yeast


## Toppings

Olives / Onion / Rosemary / Thyme / Anything!

## Instructions

- Use non-stick vegetable oil spray to lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. Drizzle about 2 tablespoons (25g) of the olive oil
- Mix flour / water / oil and yeast. Sitr until everything is incorporated into a shaggy mix. 
- Scoop the mix into the oiled pan, cover the pan, and let it rise at room temperature for 60 minutes
- While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.
- Let the dough rise in the pan, use your fingers to poke some dimples into it when it looks about right (fluffy and the thickness that your want). 
- Add your toppings and cook for 25-30 min at 375. When finished let it cool on a rack so the bottom doesn’t get soggy. Enjoy!



## Notes

I usually add some extra flour / water so it’s a little thicker dough

You could let it prove in the mixing bowl overnight - just might take a little bit longer to fill up the baking pan the next day if it’s cold and not super loose. 

Could use whole wheat / whatever other type of flour you'd like. Just might be not as fluffy. Adjust the water as needed since whole grain flours usually need a little more water
