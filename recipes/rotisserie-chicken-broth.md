## Ingredients 

- 2 chicken carcass' from rotisserie chickens (most of the skin removed)
- 1 small knob of ginger
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1/2 an onion 
- 2 carrots 
- 2 sticks of celary
- Spices of your choice

## Instructions

- Cut up veggies into large chunks and add to pot. Remove most of the chicken skin from chiken and add to pot as well. Add whatever spices you'd like - 
- Fill with cool water and let come up to a low boil
- Let it boil for 2-3 hours. Skim off any fat that floats to the surface, or you can wait till its cold to skim if off. 
- After a few hours of a low simmer use a fine mesh strainer to get the chicken and veggies out. 
- Use or freeze for later



## Notes

- Sometimes I use herbs (thyme, rosemarry, etc..), other times I'll use pho spices (star anise, cinnemon, corriander, cloves)
