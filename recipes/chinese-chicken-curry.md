## Ingredients 
(Recipe is for instant pot)

Makes 4-8 servings - easily doubles or even triples if you want

- 12 oz. boneless skinless chicken breast
(thinly sliced)
- Vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon light soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch (divided)
- 1 medium onion (halved and sliced into small wedges)
- 1 ½ cups chicken stock
- 4 teaspoons curry powder
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- salt

## Instructions

- In a medium bowl, combine the sliced chicken breast, 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch.
- Heat your wok over high heat until smoking. Add a couple tablespoons of oil, and then add the chicken to the pan in one layer. Stir-fry the chicken just until it turns opaque, and remove from the wok. Set aside.
- Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok, and add the onions. Stir-fry for one minute, then stir in the chicken stock, curry powder, turmeric, sugar, and salt to taste.
- Combine the remaining 1 teaspoon of cornstarch with 2 teaspoons of water and mix until the cornstarch is dissolved. Stir it into the curry and stock mixture, and simmer for 1 minute, until thickened. If the sauce isn’t thick enough, add more cornstarch slurry. If it’s too thick, add more chicken stock.
- Add the cooked chicken back to the wok, and stir for another 30 seconds. Serve with steamed rice.
